## *System-Administrators-Task-Completion-Prediction*
## Data found inside CSV file[Uploading SystemAdministrators.csvâ€¦]()

### This Python script uses logistic regression to predict whether a system administrator will complete a task based on their experience and training credits. The dataset is first preprocessed, converting the task completion data into binary values (1 for task completion, 0 for non-completion). A scatter plot is generated to visually explore the relationship between experience and training credits. The logistic regression model is then fitted, and model performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy metrics. Additional analysis includes the calculation of the false negative rate, a ROC curve to evaluate the model's performance, and an adjusted cutoff probability to assess its impact on classification accuracy. Lastly, the script calculates the required experience for an administrator with 4 years of training to have a probability greater than 0.5 of completing the task.
